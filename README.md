# unity_data_persistence_tutorial
This project follows the exercise given in https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/submission-data-persistence-in-a-new-repo to create persistence logic for strings and integers across multiple Scenes and via a Save/Load system.  

Since the tutorial uses the singleton paradigm in a messy way (Unity wants to create object instances where the tutorial tries to force this into a singleton pattern), I wanted to show an alternative approach that avoids singletons.
